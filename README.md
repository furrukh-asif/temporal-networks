## Description
A temporal network is a data structure for representing and reasoning about time, especially constraints on activities.  
Different kinds of temporal networks have different kinds of features (e.g., some can accommodate actions with uncertain durations, 
while others can accommodate actions that generate information in real time). This project will involve implementing algorithms from 
the literature on Temporal Networks with the aim of empirically evaluating them in reproducible ways.

## Requirement
Python3 support is needed for the module to work:
* You will also need the matplotlib and networkx modules. To install them simply use the following commands:
```
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install networkx
```

## How to use it
There is currently support for two types of temporal networks (more to be added in the future):
* Simple Temporal Networks
* Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty

### Simple Temporal Network
Add stn deets here

### Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty
Add stnu deets here

## TODO
1. Add support for other types of temporal networks, e.g., CSTNU's, Hyper Temporal Networks etc.
2. Random generation of temporal networks
